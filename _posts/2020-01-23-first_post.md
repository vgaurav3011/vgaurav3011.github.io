# Regression
The concept of mathematically describing a relationship between a set of dependent and independent variables is called regression. The dependent variable is termed as the target and the independent variable is termed as the predictor.
The idea of regression analysis is very broad ranging from varied statistical techniques, regularization, distinct target functions and thus can be of many types! I would try to clearly explain through this blog which technique should be used where and how, so that it would narrow down your choices!

The main idea is to fit a line or curve on the data points such that the difference of the distances between the point and the line are minimized. Thus, essentially regression boils down to mathematics itself!
