Welcome to Vipul Gaurav's blog. I am a final year computer science student at Sir M Visvesvarya Institute of Technology.
I am intrigued by the varied facets of statistics, its implementation and uses in machine learning and have worked with image processing and vision projects. I am the winner of the prestigious AICTE Vishwakarma Awards'19, Smart India Hackathon'19 for Goldman Sachs, NASA Space Apps Challenge India'18 and Futureskills Hackathon'18 by NASSCOM.

I started blogging recently with an aim to revisit concepts, and learn mutually in a collaborative atmosphere.
I will be working on future posts as well.
